# Machine Learning Repository
![Holberton logo](images/Holberton-Logo.png)
Welcome to the **Machine Learning Repository**! This repository hosts all of the effort I put into machine learning. You will be able to find multiple coding challenges I've had to go throught to learn the multiple concepts that go into discovering all of the nooks and crannies of the world of A.I.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into categories based on key topics in machine learning:

### üìä Math
- Covers the mathematical foundations of machine learning.
- Includes topics such as:
  - Linear algebra
  - Probability and statistics
  - Matrix operations


### ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning
- Focuses on algorithms that learn by interacting with the environment.
- Topics include:
  - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Q-learning
  - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
  - Policy gradient methods

### üß† Supervised Learning
- Includes algorithms and techniques for learning from labeled data.
- Covers:
  - Linear and logistic regression
  - Decision trees and random forests
  - Neural networks

### üåê Unsupervised Learning
- Explores techniques for uncovering patterns in unlabeled data.
- Topics include:
  - Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
  - Anomaly detection

### üõ† Pipeline
- Demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflows.
- Includes examples of:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model evaluation
